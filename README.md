# Air Quality Forecasting in Delhi–NCR

Leakage-aware AQI forecasting using scenario-based and time-series models.

---

## Overview
This project investigates hourly Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction for the Delhi–NCR region under different real-world information constraints.

---

## Dataset
Hourly AQI, meteorological, and temporal data collected from multiple monitoring stations across Delhi–NCR.

---

## Modeling Framework
The study evaluates AQI prediction under three scenarios:
1. Baseline AQI reconstruction (upper bound)
2. Sensor-free early warning model
3. Lag-based time-series forecasting model

---

## Results Summary
Key findings highlight the trade-off between information availability and predictive performance.
